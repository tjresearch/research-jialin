# Voice-Controlled Graphing Calculator
## Overview
Blind and physically-impaired people struggle with using physical graphing calculators such as TI-84s because they either have a hard time pressing the buttons or cannot see the graphs. My proposal is to create an online voice recognition graphing calculator that would enable users to dictate their commands to the program, listen to the calculatorâ€™s output, and envision graphs based on sound pitches outputted by the calculator.
## Requirements
In order to run this code, you will need to have these Python libraries installed:
* word2number and num2words
* numpy
* matplotlib
* mpmath
* sympy
* scipy
* statistics
* pandas
* math
* random
* fractions
* tkinter
* pyaudio
* SpeechRecognition
* gTTS
* time
* multiprocessing
* threading
* playsound
- Make sure you have a microphone for voice recognition purposes
## Installation Instructions
1. Install any version of Python 3 and all required libraries
2. Download the calculator.py source code and test.txt for the "Help" button
## Run Instructions
Run the code using a command prompt. Note: You may have to repeat a command multiple times to obtain the desired output from speech recognition.
